# Oop
Here are the Object Oriented Programs:

1)The first 21 lines contains the program for bank account.
Purpose:
Simulates a real bank account system. It helps manage operations like depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance for different users.
Use:
Useful in finance-related projects, and shows how to manage state (balance) and user-specific data using objects.

2)The next program is for Student management.
Purpose:
Keeps track of student data like name, roll number, and grade. You can create multiple students and display their info.
Use:
This kind of structure is used in student information systems, school/college portals, or attendance tracking apps.

3)Purpose:
Represents library items like books, using a parent-child structure. The base class handles common info (title), while the child class adds specific info (like author for books).
Use:
Useful in library or inventory systems. It shows how to reuse code through inheritance, a core concept of OOP.

4)Purpose:
Demonstrates how different objects can perform the same action (speak), but in their own way (bark, meow, etc.).
Use:
Important for building flexible systems. For example, in a game, you might have different types of characters, each with their own behavior, but all respond to the same command like move() or attack().

5)Purpose:
Keeps track of employee names and salaries. Helps display salary details when needed.
Use:
Good for payroll systems or HR management tools. Shows how to represent real-world entities like employees using classes.
